# Duck in the wild

Using Maptiler JS SDK and THREE.js library to create a 3D model of a rubber duck and display it on the map.

URL: `https://nirzhuk.github.io/maptiler-duck/`


## Time spent

- The most time consuming part of this project was reading the documentation and understanding what part of Maplibre and Maptiler SDK is needed for this project. 1-2 hours.
- Coding was less time consuming thanks to the documentation which I feel helped me a lot. 1-2 hours.
- Github pages and setup of the project took less than 1 hour.


## Decisions

- I decided to use biome due I recently used in my projects due not need to have prettier and eslint files around my project.
- Decided to use `three.js` library due I'm more familiar how it's working and how to use it. (gltf loader mostly)
- Using plain `ts` instead of react due I want to keep it simple and easy to understand. 

## Run the application

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

## Build the application

```bash
pnpm run build
```
